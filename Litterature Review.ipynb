Researchers have paid much attention\\\\non its partially observable and cooperative settings for meeting real-world\\\\nrequirements. For testing performance of different algorithms, standardized\\\\nenvironments are designed such as the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which is\\\\none of the most successful MARL benchmarks. To our best knowledge, most of\\\\ncurrent environments are synchronous, where agents execute actions in the same\\\\npace. However, heterogeneous agents usually have their own action spaces and\\\\nthere is no guarantee for actions from different agents to have the same\\\\nexecuted cycle, which leads to asynchronous multi-agent cooperation. Inspired\\\\nfrom the Wargame, a confrontation game between two armies abstracted from real\\\\nworld environment, we propose the first Partially Observable Asynchronous\\\\nmulti-agent Cooperation challenge (POAC) for the MARL community. Specifically,\\\\nPOAC supports two teams of heterogeneous agents to fight with each other, where\\\\nan agent selects actions based on its own observations and cooperates\\\\nasynchronously with its allies. Moreover, POAC is a light weight, flexible and\\\\neasy to use environment, which can be configured by users to meet different\\\\nexperimental requirements such as self-play model, human-AI model and so on.\\\\nAlong with our benchmark, we offer six game scenarios of varying difficulties\\\\nwith the built-in rule-based AI as opponents. Finally, since most MARL\\\\nalgorithms are designed for synchronous agents, we revise several\\\\nrepresentatives to meet the asynchronous setting, and the relatively poor\\\\nexperimental results validate the challenge of POAC.

However, existing single-agent approaches face limitations in\\\\ngenerating and improving large-scale, complex codebases due to constraints in\\\\ncontext length. To tackle this challenge, we propose Self-Organized multi-Agent\\\\nframework (SoA), a novel multi-agent framework that enables the scalable and\\\\nefficient generation and optimization of large-scale code. In SoA,\\\\nself-organized agents operate independently to generate and modify code\\\\ncomponents while seamlessly collaborating to construct the overall codebase. A\\\\nkey feature of our framework is the automatic multiplication of agents based on\\\\nproblem complexity, allowing for dynamic scalability.

      "### Literature Review on No-Code Tools for Building Multi-Agent AI Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "The growing complexity of artificial intelligence (AI) system development has catalyzed the emergence of no-code tools, especially within the domain of multi-agent systems (MAS). These systems leverage the capabilities of multiple agents, often utilizing generative AI models, to collaborate and solve complex tasks across various domains (Dibia et al., 2024). The advent of no-code approaches provides avenues for organizations to implement AI solutions without deep programming knowledge, thereby democratizing access to technology and expanding utilization in business processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Overview of Multi-Agent Systems and No-Code Tools\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-agent systems are characterized by the interaction of autonomous agents, which can autonomously operate and communicate to achieve collective goals. The conventional programming approaches to develop MAS can be daunting due to their complexity and the requirement for extensive coding skills. No-code development platforms mitigate these issues by simplifying task management, enabling users to define agent workflows visually through drag-and-drop interfaces (Jeong et al., 2025). This allows users to prototype, debug, and deploy multi-agent workflows with less reliance on traditional programming methodologies (Dibia et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, **AutoGen Studio**, a no-code tool, has been designed to facilitate the rapid prototyping and debugging of multi-agent workflows. It employs a user-friendly interface where users can define workflows using declarative specifications, supporting interactive evaluations of agent interactions (Dibia et al., 2024). Such tools not only enhance the confidence of developers who may not be proficient in coding but also provide reusable components that can speed up the development process.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### The Role of No-Code in AI Adoption\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of no-code tools in MAS significantly lowers the barriers to AI adoption, particularly for enterprises that may lack the technical infrastructure and expertise. Jeong (2025) illustrates this through a multimodal LLM-based multi-agent system that enables users to leverage advanced AI applications without extensive programming backgrounds. The study showcases how no-code platforms can facilitate innovations in areas such as automatic code generation and image processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, **Beyond Text** details the practical implications of using no-code frameworks that permit users to build sophisticated AI systems, ultimately contributing to improved productivity and efficiency in business functions (Jeong, 2025). As organizations continue to strive for enhanced operational efficiencies, the scalability and accessibility of these platforms are critical for integrating AI into everyday business processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Comparative Frameworks and Collaborative Efforts\n",
      "\n",
      "Innovations within the realm of no-code development are also reflected in collaborative frameworks. For example, the **Co-Learning framework** employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to assist in code correction tasks, demonstrating a tangible application of no-code tools for specialized needs (Yu et al., 2024). This collaboration among agents not only enhances functionality but also offers insights into the capabilities of no-code tools in supporting specific domain-oriented applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the literature elaborates on initiatives like **Self-Organized Agents**, which suggest a decentralized approach to code management across vast codebases by employing multiple agents that work collaboratively yet independently (Ishibashi & Nishimura, 2024). The ability to scale agent operations dynamically according to context complexity is a significant advantage in tackling large and cumbersome software projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Challenges in Multi-Agent System Development\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the advantages presented by no-code tools, challenges remain in areas such as debugging and the orchestration of agent interactions (Hymel et al., 2024). These issues underscore the importance of ongoing research and development to refine no-code solutions that can adequately manage the complexity associated with multi-agent configurations. As the variety of tools expands, understanding the interplay between these agents and addressing potential inefficiencies will be crucial for optimizing performance in practical applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, no-code tools are transforming the landscape of multi-agent system development by making AI technologies more accessible to a broader audience. Future directions in this field will likely include refined methodologies for orchestration, enhanced capabilities for debugging, and continued exploration of the efficacy of no-code frameworks across various domains.\n",

These systems leverage the capabilities of multiple agents, often utilizing generative AI models, to collaborate and solve complex tasks across various domains (Dibia et al., 2024). The advent of no-code approaches provides avenues for organizations to implement AI solutions without deep programming knowledge, thereby democratizing access to technology and expanding utilization in business processes.\\n\\n#### Overview of Multi-Agent Systems and No-Code Tools\\n\\nMulti-agent systems are characterized by the interaction of autonomous agents, which can autonomously operate and communicate to achieve collective goals. The conventional programming approaches to develop MAS can be daunting due to their complexity and the requirement for extensive coding skills. No-code development platforms mitigate these issues by simplifying task management, enabling users to define agent workflows visually through drag-and-drop interfaces (Jeong et al., 2025). This allows users to prototype, debug, and deploy multi-agent workflows with less reliance on traditional programming methodologies (Dibia et al., 2024).\\n\\nFor instance, **AutoGen Studio**, a no-code tool, has been designed to facilitate the rapid prototyping and debugging of multi-agent workflows. It employs a user-friendly interface where users can define workflows using declarative specifications, supporting interactive evaluations of agent interactions (Dibia et al., 2024). Such tools not only enhance the confidence of developers who may not be proficient in coding but also provide reusable components that can speed up the development process.\\n\\n#### The Role of No-Code in AI Adoption\\n\\nThe integration of no-code tools in MAS significantly lowers the barriers to AI adoption, particularly for enterprises that may lack the technical infrastructure and expertise. Jeong (2025) illustrates this through a multimodal LLM-based multi-agent system that enables users to leverage advanced AI applications without extensive programming backgrounds. The study showcases how no-code platforms can facilitate innovations in areas such as automatic code generation and image processing.\\n\\nMoreover, **Beyond Text** details the practical implications of using no-code frameworks that permit users to build sophisticated AI systems, ultimately contributing to improved productivity and efficiency in business functions (Jeong, 2025). As organizations continue to strive for enhanced operational efficiencies, the scalability and accessibility of these platforms are critical for integrating AI into everyday business processes.\\n\\n#### Comparative Frameworks and Collaborative Efforts\\n\\nInnovations within the realm of no-code development are also reflected in collaborative frameworks. For example, the **Co-Learning framework** employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to assist in code correction tasks, demonstrating a tangible application of no-code tools for specialized needs (Yu et al., 2024). This collaboration among agents not only enhances functionality but also offers insights into the capabilities of no-code tools in supporting specific domain-oriented applications.\\n\\nFurthermore, the literature elaborates on initiatives like **Self-Organized Agents**, which suggest a decentralized approach to code management across vast codebases by employing multiple agents that work collaboratively yet independently (Ishibashi & Nishimura, 2024). The ability to scale agent operations dynamically according to context complexity is a significant advantage in tackling large and cumbersome software projects.\\n\\n#### Challenges in Multi-Agent System Development\\n\\nDespite the advantages presented by no-code tools, challenges remain in areas such as debugging and the orchestration of agent interactions (Hymel et al., 2024). These issues underscore the importance of ongoing research and development to refine no-code solutions that can adequately manage the complexity associated with multi-agent configurations. As the variety of tools expands, understanding the interplay between these agents and addressing potential inefficiencies will be crucial for optimizing performance in practical applications.\\n\\nIn conclusion, no-code tools are transforming the landscape of multi-agent system development by making AI technologies more accessible to a broader audience. Future directions in this field will likely include refined methodologies for orchestration, enhanced capabilities for debugging, and continued exploration of the efficacy of no-code frameworks across various domains.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n1.
